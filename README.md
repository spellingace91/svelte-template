# Svelte + Vite + Jest/Testing Library + Tailwind + eslint/Prettier

I have modified the Svelte + Vite template to includes packages/features that I frequently install when starting a new Svelte project: Jest/Testing Library, Tailwind, and eslint/Pretter (with Svelte Options).

For each of these packages, I have installed the necessary packages and added the corresponding config files.

For Tailwind, I also placed the `@tailwind` directives in a new file at `src/index.css`, and imported that CSS file into `App.svelte`.
